## Project Overview
The **VendingMachine** project is a Java-based console application that simulates the functionality of a vending machine. It allows users to select products, process payments, and dispense items, mimicking the operations of a real-world vending machine.

## Features
- **Product Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of products available in the vending machine.

- **Payment Processing**: The application handles payment transactions, ensuring that the correct amount is received before dispensing the selected product.

- **Inventory Management**: It keeps track of the inventory, updating the stock levels as products are dispensed.

## Lessons Learned
Developing this project provided valuable insights into:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementing classes and objects to model real-world entities such as products and transactions.

- **Exception Handling**: Managing errors gracefully to ensure the application runs smoothly under various scenarios.

- **User Interaction**: Creating a user-friendly console interface to interact with the vending machine.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/thuliovs/VendingMachine.git

2. **Compile the Code**: Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java source files.

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the compiled program to start the vending machine simulation.
